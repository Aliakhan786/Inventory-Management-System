# 📦 Inventory Management System (C++ Internship Project Task 3)

## 📌 Task Overview
This is Task 3 of the **C++ Programming Internship**. It is a console-based Inventory Management System developed using **Object-Oriented Programming** and **File Handling** in C++.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a simple product inventory system that can:
- Add new products
- View all products
- Update stock
- Search products by ID
- Display low stock alerts (Bonus)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- Concepts: Classes, File Handling (`fstream`), STL (`map`, `vector`), OOP Principles

## ✅ Features Implemented
- [x] Add product (ID, Name, Price, Quantity)
- [x] View all products in tabular form
- [x] Update stock quantity
- [x] Search product by ID
- [x] Low stock alert system (quantity < 5)
- [x] Persistent storage using file (`inventory.txt`)
- [x] Clean and modular code with STL usage
